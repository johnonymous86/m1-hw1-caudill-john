## About Me
My name is John Caudill. I was born in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. I graduated from the University of South Florida in 2012 with a BA in writing. Currently, I live in the mountains of Southwest Virginia. I like to read, write, hike, run, and play music. 

## Past Coding Experience
During college, my work study position gave me the opportunity to create content for a museum website, including learning how to build pages and manipulate photos. After graduating college, I started experiementing with Blogger and WordPress as a means of self-publishing my writing. During COVID, I relocated to Southwest Virginia and started working at Wytheville Community College in Wytheville, Virginia. When the position of Webmaster became available, I applied and have been doing that since. This involves working with a Drupal CMS hosted on a Pantheon cloud server and doing a significant amount of graphic design and coding in HTML. 

## Career Goals
1. I would like to learn more coding languages.
2. I would like to be proficient at working with a LAMP stack.
3. I would like to become a skilled web developer.
